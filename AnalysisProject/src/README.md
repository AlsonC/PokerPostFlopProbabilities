Hello! This is a program I wrote for my Analysis Honors class at Henry. M Gunn High School for the school year 2020-2021. 
It uses Java to provide comprehensive probabilities for 'hitting' a given hand, given a 'flop' and your own hand.

Only 'hands' Royal Flush through Straight are completed due to Three of a Kind and below being quite easy to deduct mentally.
